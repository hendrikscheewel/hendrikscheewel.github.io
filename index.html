<b>The Geography of Climate Migration </b><br>
<i>with Burzynski, M. & F. Docquier</i><br>
<i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/dem.2021.6"> J. Demogr. Econ.</a></i><br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: We investigate the long-term effects of climate change on the mobility of working-age people. We use a world economy model that covers almost all countries in the world, distinguishes between rural and urban regions as well as
flooded and unflooded areas. The model is calibrated to match international and internal mobility data by education level for the last 30 years, and is then simulated under climate change variants. We endogenize the size, dyadic and skill
structure of climate migration. Considering moderate climate scenarios, we predict mobility responses in the range of 70 to 108 million workers over the course of the 21st century. Most of these movements are local or inter-regional.
South-South international migration responses are smaller, while the South-North migration response is of the "brain drain" type and induces a permanent increase in the stock of foreigners in the OECD countries in the range of 6 to
9% only. Changes in the sea level mainly translate into forced local movements. On the contrary, inter-regional and international movements are sensitive to temperature-related changes in productivity. We finally show that relaxing
international migration restrictions may exacerbate the poverty effect of climate change at origin if policymakers are unable to select/screen individuals in extreme poverty.

<b>Immigration, Welfare and Inequality: How Much Does the Labor Market Specification Matter?</b><br>
<i>with F. Docquier & B. I. Ikhenaode</i><br>
<i>Working paper</i><br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Macroeconomic models are increasingly used to quantify the welfare and inequality effects of immigration in the OECD countries. Existing studies differ in the way they formalize the labor market responses for immigrants and
natives, which in turn govern the strength of the other transmission channels (e.g., public finances, price index, or total factor productivity). In this paper, we build a general equilibrium model that allows to gauge the role of the labor market
specification. We parameterize the model for 20 selected OECD member states and compare several specifications involving different assumptions concerning labor supply decisions, unemployment rates and wage formation, as well
as different calibration strategies. Results are highly robust to the specification and calibration of the labor market block. Endogenizing unemployment and participation generates slightly more optimistic results. However, these labor
market mechanisms do not reverse the findings of models based on simpler assumptions and have little effects on cross-country differences in responses to immigration. The labor market specification is less important than the calibration
of the elasticity of substitution between immigrants and natives.

<b>The Veil of Ignorance: Does Disclosure of Nationalities in Police Press Releases foster Migration Skepticism?</b><br>
<i>with Erik Haustein & Yannik Schenk</i><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: The alleged link between immigration and crime has been amongst the key narratives behind the recent upsurge of right-wing populism all around the globe. Whether the police should systematically reveal offenders’ national origins in press releases is a highly controversial topic. Advocates of systematic disclosure argue that unconditional transparency prevents mistrust in state institutions and media, while opponents point out the risk that systematic reporting of nationality in the context of crime could promote prejudices by suggesting a causal link between citizenship and delinquency. Although, there have been several attempts to implement a uniform Germany-wide regulation, no agreement could be reached to date. We analyze how different reporting practices influence natives’ perceptions of immigrants to derive evidence based policy recommendations. To this end, we collected over 1.5 million police press releases between 2015 and 2020 from 220 local police authorities. We use text-mining methods to classify offenses and nationalities in individual press releases. Collapsing the data to regionally meaningful indicators, we document large heterogeneity in practices across and within German federal states. 
In a second step, we map these indicators to geo-referenced survey data on individual attitudes towards migration in Germany. To establish a causal link between police practices and individual attitudes we exploit the conditionally random allocation of cases to authors with heterogeneous preferences within police stations, measured by their historic reporting behavior. Using predicted shares of press releases with nationality references, based on respective contributions of different authors in a specific month, we create arguably exogenous instruments for our treatment variable. In line with recent research on the representation of foreigner crime in print media, our preliminary findings suggest that a systematic indication of nationalities in all press releases would lower concern about immigration. This finding emphasizes the importance of transparency as a suitable tool to dispel fears instigated by right-wing populist rhetoric.
