<b>The Geography of Climate Migration </b><br>
<i>with Burzynski, M. & F. Docquier</i><br>
<i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/dem.2021.6"> J. Demogr. Econ.</a></i><br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: We investigate the long-term effects of climate change on the mobility of working-age people. We use a world economy model that covers almost all countries in the world, distinguishes between rural and urban regions as well as
flooded and unflooded areas. The model is calibrated to match international and internal mobility data by education level for the last 30 years, and is then simulated under climate change variants. We endogenize the size, dyadic and skill
structure of climate migration. Considering moderate climate scenarios, we predict mobility responses in the range of 70 to 108 million workers over the course of the 21st century. Most of these movements are local or inter-regional.
South-South international migration responses are smaller, while the South-North migration response is of the "brain drain" type and induces a permanent increase in the stock of foreigners in the OECD countries in the range of 6 to
9% only. Changes in the sea level mainly translate into forced local movements. On the contrary, inter-regional and international movements are sensitive to temperature-related changes in productivity. We finally show that relaxing
international migration restrictions may exacerbate the poverty effect of climate change at origin if policymakers are unable to select/screen individuals in extreme poverty.

<b>Immigration, Welfare and Inequality: How Much Does the Labor Market Specification Matter?</b><br>
<i>with F. Docquier & B. I. Ikhenaode</i><br>
<i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/roie.12615">Rev. Int. Econ.</a></i><br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
General equilibrium models are frequently used to estimate the effect of immigration on welfare and inequality in the host country. Existing studies differ in the way they formalize the labor market implications for natives, which in turn govern the strength of the other transmission mechanisms. To assess the extent to which the choice of the labor market specification influences the findings, we build an encompassing model that distinguishes between broad classes of individuals. We calibrate it for 20 selected OECD member states, and compare several specifications involving different assumptions on labor supply decisions, unemployment rates and wage formation, as well as different calibration strategies. The size and the sign of the average welfare and distributional effects of immigration are robust to the labor market specification. Endogenizing unemployment and participation rates leads to slightly better welfare and distributional results in most OECD countries but overall, adding margins of labor market adjustment barely affects the findings of models based on simpler assumptions.

<b>The Need for a Tweet: Foreigner Criminality in Police Press Releases and Hate Speech on Social Media</b><br>
<i>with Erik Haustein & Yannik Schenk</i><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: This study investigates the role of police communication in shaping public discourse on social media in the context of immigration, crime, and political populism. We compile a unique dataset of more than 1.5 million press releases from 220 local German police entities published between 2016 and 2022 and analyze the implications of disclosing perpetrators' national origins when reporting on crime. Utilizing an instrumental variable approach, we attempt to disentangle the causal effect of naming suspects' nationalities in press releases from the general societal climate. Our findings indicate that disclosing nationalities leads to a higher likelihood of observing a police press release on Twitter, increased user engagement, and a rise in hateful posts, predominantly driven by disclosed nationalities of perpetrators from Muslim-majority countries. We then analyze a unilateral policy change in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania towards default reporting of nationalities. Our findings suggest that the policy mainly increased the frequency of press releases featuring German suspects. However, we find no significant evidence for a systematic change in the outreach and tone of discussions regarding crime news on Twitter.
